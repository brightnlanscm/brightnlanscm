Need an online payday loan to purchase gas? You may if you live in California. The prices have jumped up an average of close to one dollar per gallon in less than two weeks leaving many in the workforce struggling just to get to work.

Refinery and pipeline problems have put a squeeze on the fuel supply which created record high prices at the pump. Areas which are highly affected by unemployment are being hit with the highest prices. How can I get a payday loan when I have no job and cannot afford fuel to get there? Many areas in Southern California are shelling out close to $5.00 per gallon.

Californians may catch a break if the Governor's request for early release of the winter's blend of gas is approved. The winter blend is a gas which evaporates more readily into the environment during hot weather. The summer blend is less harmful to the environment. Usually, the winter blend does not hit the market until the end of October, but even if it does get released early, it will take several days for price relief to hit their tanks.
